Here I uploaded some projects small and large. They all are usefull in some way. 
Check out the projects and share some suggestions and opinions.



IMAGE_DOWNLOADER: 

This a script that downloads an image from the url and save it to your specified path in the storage.
You have to just provide an url or an adderess and the path directory in which you want to save that image, to this script.
After downloading and saving the image to your directory , it wil resize the image accoarding to your desired size and then again save it to the specified path in your directory.
That's why you can see two images in your directory named downloaded_image and resized_image.


QR CODE GENERATOR:

This script simply makes an qr code image and simply save it to path you specify.
You just have to provide it with the text or the url and it will automatically generates an qr_code for it.
Then you have to just scan that generated qr_code and you will be able to see the content of it, wether it is a text or a url.
